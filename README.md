# Experiment-TensorFlow-Recurrent-Neural-Network-Training

This is a repo for an updated script I made (based off of some starter code of Erik Hallström) for experimenting with TensorFlow to train a recurrent neural network using input data this is a random binary vector. The output predictions will be the “echo” of the input that is essentially shifted so many cycles/steps steps to the right of the original generated data.
